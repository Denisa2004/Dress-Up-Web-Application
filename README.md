## 📖 Project Context: Software Development Methods

This project was developed by a team of 5 students for the "Software Development Methods" course. The primary goal was not just to deliver a functional product, but to simulate a professional industry environment by emphasizing a structured development process.

* **Methodology:** We adopted the **Agile (Scrum)** framework.
* **Project Management:** We used **Jira** to manage our entire development lifecycle.
* **Requirements:** The project was built from the ground up based on **User Stories**, defining features from the perspective of our key roles (Guest, User, Admin).
* **Planning:** Development was organized into **Sprints**, each with clear goals and deliverables, allowing our team to iterate and adapt effectively.
